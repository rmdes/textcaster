# RSC Migration and Cutover Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Ship the v2 inbound push subsystem V3 deferred, the preflight command
and versioned manifest, the one atomic marker-guarded legacy conversion with
exact ID/permalink/follow/push preservation, the two cutover tripwires, the
ops-token compatibility route, the operator runbook, and — as a separate
soaked release — legacy retirement. Everything stays behind startup-immutable
`RSC_SOURCE_MODEL_V2=off` until the operator flips it per instance.

**Architecture:** The v2 push subsystem is v1's two-state runtime shape
rebuilt over sources: registration/renewal ride V2's one poll loop, callbacks
reuse the existing public routes with handlers supplied by the v2 branch, and
the parse-time capability claim on `acquisition_runs_v2` is the durable fact.
Conversion is one pre-listen write transaction extending V2 §7.1's activation
barrier, guarded by a durable marker on `logical_activation_v2`; findings are
log lines plus per-kind counts in the marker. No new loops, no new command
idiom, no rollback machinery beyond the pre-flip backup.

**Tech Stack:** Node 22 native TypeScript, Hono, better-sqlite3/Kysely,
feedsmith, Vitest, SvelteKit 2, Svelte 5.

**Revision:** 1 — initial draft against spec rev 1
(`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-rsc-migration-cutover-design.md`). The
spec's settled decisions (one-transaction conversion inside V2's pre-listen
activation; startup-error flip-back; two-state push runtime with
delete-on-denial/purge-expired; findings as log lines + marker counts;
gate-assertion off-flag coverage; run-claim on `acquisition_runs_v2`; no
post-purge reservation branch; the active-without-marker tripwire) are
**do-not-relitigate**.

**Status:** Draft — awaiting the standing plan review, then the Task 12
cross-vertical contract review. Execution of Tasks 1–10 is gated on V1–V3
being implemented and reviewed; Task 11 is a separate post-soak release;
Task 12 executes FIRST in wall-clock order (it gates every vertical's
implementation).

## Global Constraints

- Governing spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-22-rsc-migration-cutover-design.md` rev 1. Foundation: `2026-07-20-rsc-source-governance-moderation-design.md` rev 3 + its two 2026-07-22 amendments.
- Prerequisites: V1 plan rev 5, V2 plan rev 5 **plus the three V2 rev 6 lockstep amendments below**, and V3 plan rev 2, all implemented and reviewed. Refuse execution if any amendment did not land in V2's execution.
- `RSC_SOURCE_MODEL_V2` stays startup-immutable, default off. With v2 off no V4 route, worker, or write path is active; legacy behavior — including legacy push-in — is byte-identical and covered by the existing legacy suites (spec rev 1 WP1/WP3: no duplicated legacy suite, no third/fourth push state).
- **No new environment variable for push**: v2 inbound push is effective exactly when `RSC_PUSH_IN=on` and `RSC_PUBLIC_URL` is set — the existing `pushInEffective` rule (`core/src/domain/push-in.ts:48-50`, `core/src/config.ts:60-62`). The only new variable is `RSC_MIGRATION_MANIFEST` (optional manifest path, Task 4).
- **No new scheduling loop**: registration rides the poll pass after each successful acquisition commit; one renewal sweep plus expired-row purge ends each pass, exactly as v1's `runPollCycle` does today (`push-in.ts:271-272`).
- Conversion sends **no network requests** and runs at most once, marker-guarded, inside the single pre-listen activation transaction. Migrations stay strictly tail-appended to the `user_version`-indexed `MIGRATIONS` array (`core/src/storage/sqlite.ts:566`, applied ascending at `:706-709`).
- Outbound push (`core/src/domain/push.ts`, the `subscriptions` table, migration 2 at `sqlite.ts:592-604`) is untouched in every task.
- One SQLite `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` write transaction per mutation via the V2 `DatabaseContext.write()` idiom. Reuse V2's exported helpers by exact name: `createDatabaseContext`, `createLogicalStore`, `LogicalReadTx`, `appendJournal`, `encodeCursor`/`decodeCursor`, `AdminPage<T>`, and the exported `jsonWrite` guard (`core/src/api/app.ts`, `MAX_JSON_BYTES` at `:63`) — compose by import, never redefine. Command IDs travel only as the `commandId` JSON body field.
- Core route tasks must invoke `.claude/skills/hono/SKILL.md`. Web tasks must invoke the repository UI/Svelte skills and follow `design-system/rsc/MASTER.md`.
- No TypeScript parameter properties in `core/src`; no new dependency.
- Stage explicit paths only. Every commit ends with `developed with the help of AI tools`.
- Test commands follow `docs/superpowers/documentation/TESTING.md`: in-container when the dev stack is running, otherwise host commands as written.

## Lockstep amendments to the V2 plan (rev 6, REQUIRED before any execution)

Same mechanism as the V4 §10 CHECK pin (amending V1 rev 5) and V3's three
amendments (applied in V2 rev 5). SQLite cannot widen a CHECK or relax a
column without a table rebuild, so these must land in V2's plan **before V2
executes**; the Task 12 review folds them and re-verifies. This plan refuses
execution if V2's executed revision predates them.

1. **`acquisition_runs_v2.reason` CHECK is created WIDE.** V2's Appendix A
   pins `CHECK(reason IN('scheduled','administrator_refresh'))`, but spec
   §1.4 routes push ingestion through the same acquisition path: a fat-ping
   body commits as a run (`observation_versions_v2.run_id` is `NOT NULL`)
   and a thin ping triggers a one-shot run. The CHECK becomes
   `IN('scheduled','administrator_refresh','push_delivery','push_ping')`;
   V2's TS `AcquisitionReason` union stays narrow (V2 writes only the first
   two) and V4 widens the TS union at consumption — the same
   wide-CHECK/narrow-enum pattern as the V4 §10 pin.
2. **`presentation_entries_v2.provenance` CHECK is created WIDE.** V2's
   Appendix A pins `CHECK(provenance IN('explicit','arrival'))`, but spec
   §3.2 converts legacy revisions with provenance `legacy_unknown`. The
   CHECK becomes `IN('explicit','arrival','legacy_unknown')`; V2's TS
   provenance type stays two-valued until V4's declared wire widening
   (spec §10 item 6 — V2's provenance tests already assert membership, not
   exhaustive equality).
3. **`push_capability_json` shape is pinned.** V2 writes it inert; V4 is its
   only reader. The stored value is `JSON.stringify` of the
   `choosePushTarget` result shape — `{mode:'websub'|'rsscloud',
   endpoint:string, topic:string}` — or SQL NULL when the feed advertises
   nothing. (Also fix the stale pointer in V2 Appendix A: the column is
   "validated only by Vertical **4**", not 3 — push left V3 entirely.)
   V4 parses defensively regardless: a malformed value is treated as
   no-capability plus one log line, never a crash.

## File map and shared interfaces

Create focused modules; extend — never fork — the V2 store, scheduler,
runtime, and routes:

```text
core/src/logical/push.ts           v2 push: lifecycle, registration, renewal, callbacks
core/src/migration/preflight.ts    read-only checks + manifest loading/validation
core/src/migration/preflight-cli.ts  tiny CLI entry (npm run preflight -w core)
core/src/migration/convert.ts      the one-transaction conversion + marker
```

Modified: `core/src/logical/{schema,types,store,scheduler,runtime}.ts`,
`core/src/api/{app,logical-routes}.ts`, `core/src/domain/types.ts`,
`core/src/storage/sqlite.ts`, `core/src/config.ts`, `core/src/server.ts`,
plus the small web surfaces named per task.

`core/src/domain/types.ts` — intentional TS supersessions (SQL CHECKs are
already wide; V1 rev 5 pin):

```ts
export type AuditCategory = /* V3's eight */ | 'migration_review' // first emitter: conversion (Task 5)
// SourceAuditEvent.actorKind widens: 'administrator' | 'operator_token' | 'system'
// CommandEnvelope.actorScope widens: 'owner' | 'administrator' | 'ops' | 'system'
// establishFederation input actorKind widens: 'administrator' | 'operator_token'
export interface SourceSummary { /* V1 fields */ push: PushSummary } // V1-deferred, first written here
export interface PushSummary {
  mode: PushProtocol | null
  state: 'pending' | 'active' | null            // two-state union (spec 1.2/1.5)
  endpointFingerprint: string | null            // sha256(endpoint) first 16 hex — non-secret
}
// SourceDetail gains pushExpiresAt: string | null (admin page shows expiry)
```

`core/src/logical/push.ts` exports:

```ts
export type PushClaim = PushTarget // {mode: PushProtocol; endpoint: string; topic: string} — reused from push-in.ts
export function parsePushCapability(json: string | null): PushClaim | null // defensive; malformed → null + log
export interface PushRowV2 {
  id: string; sourceId: string; mode: PushProtocol; endpoint: string; topic: string
  callbackToken: string; secret: string | null
  state: 'pending' | 'active'; expiresAt: string; createdAt: string
}
export function createLogicalPush(deps: {
  db: DatabaseContext; store: ReturnType<typeof createLogicalStore>
  sourceRepository: SourceRepository; config: Config
  fetchFn?: typeof fetch; lookupFn?: LookupFn
}): {
  maybeRegister(sourceId: string, claim: PushClaim | null): Promise<void>
  renewDue(): Promise<void>
  hasActivePush(sourceId: string, now: string): boolean
  handleWebSubVerification(token: string, query: Record<string, string>): Promise<{status: number; body: string}>
  handleFatPing(token: string, body: string, signatureHeader: string | null): Promise<number>
  handleRssCloudChallenge(url: string, challenge: string): Promise<{status: number; body: string}>
  handleThinPing(url: string): Promise<number>
}
```

The pure v1 helpers are **imported, not rewritten**: `verifySignature`,
`choosePushTarget`, `pushInEffective`, and the constants
`PENDING_TTL_MS`/`WEBSUB_LEASE_SECONDS`/`WEBSUB_RENEW_HORIZON_MS`/
`RSSCLOUD_TTL_MS`/`RSSCLOUD_RENEW_HORIZON_MS`/`RENEW_RETRY_FLOOR_MS`
(`core/src/domain/push-in.ts:16-26,30-39,41-46,48-50`). Task 11 (retirement)
moves them into `logical/push.ts` when the v1 module dies; until then the v1
module is their home and stays byte-identical.

`createLogicalStore(db)`'s returned object gains (implementation in
`store.ts` over `push_subscriptions_v2`; same idiom as the legacy repo
methods at `core/src/domain/repository.ts:51-55`):

```ts
findPushRow(filter: {token?: string; sourceId?: string; mode?: PushProtocol; topic?: string},
            opts?: {unexpiredAt?: string; state?: 'pending' | 'active'}): PushRowV2 | undefined
upsertPushRow(tx: WriteTx, row: PushRowV2): void
deletePushRow(tx: WriteTx, id: string): void
listRenewablePushRows(horizon: string): PushRowV2[]
purgeExpiredPushRows(tx: WriteTx, now: string): void
```

`core/src/migration/preflight.ts` / `convert.ts`:

```ts
export interface ManifestEntry {sourceId: string; feedUrl: string; attributionMode: AttributionMode; note: string}
export interface Manifest {schemaVersion: 1; entries: ManifestEntry[]}
export function loadManifest(path: string | null): Manifest | null // throws named diagnostics on every abort class
export interface PreflightFinding {kind:
  | 'invalid_url' | 'url_collision' | 'manifest_invalid' | 'manifest_unknown_entry'
  | 'manifest_mismatch' | 'manifest_duplicate' | 'handle_reservation_collision'
  detail: string}
export function runPreflight(raw: BetterSqlite3.Database, manifest: Manifest | null): PreflightFinding[] // [] = clean; READ-ONLY

export type ConversionCounts = Record<ConversionFindingKind, number>
export type ConversionFindingKind =
  | 'default_person' | 'default_webfeed' | 'instance_quarantined' | 'manifest_approved'
  | 'attribution_conflict' | 'unresolved_reference' | 'permalink_collision' | 'guid_collision'
  | 'push_preserved' | 'push_expired' | 'push_invalid' | 'over_cap_grandfathered'
export function runConversion(tx: WriteTx, input: {
  manifest: Manifest | null; now: string; log: (line: string) => void
}): ConversionCounts // marker + reset written by the caller (runtime), same transaction
```

`AcquisitionReason` (V2 type) widens — intentional supersession, mirroring
V3's `ReconciliationClaim` widening:

```ts
export type AcquisitionReason =
  | {kind: 'scheduled'}
  | {kind: 'administrator'; command: CommandEnvelope}
  | {kind: 'push_delivery'; body: string; signatureOk: true}  // fat ping — fetch skipped, body is the document
  | {kind: 'push_ping'}                                        // thin ping — ordinary fetch
```

### Task 1: V4 schema, widened TS contracts, and the amendment tripwire

**Files:** Modify `core/src/logical/schema.ts`, `core/src/logical/types.ts`,
`core/src/domain/types.ts`, `core/src/storage/sqlite.ts`,
`core/src/config.ts`; create `core/test/v4-schema.test.ts`; modify
`core/test/config.test.ts`.

**Interfaces:** Produces the Appendix A tables/columns, the TS widenings from
the shared-interfaces block, and `Config.migrationManifestPath`. No behavior.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Add `v4-schema.test.ts` asserting: `push_subscriptions_v2`
  and `handle_reservations_v2` exist with the Appendix A shapes after
  migration; `logical_activation_v2` accepts `converted_at` /
  `conversion_findings_json` writes; `push_subscriptions_v2.state` rejects
  any value outside `('pending','active')` (the two-state pin, spec 1.2) and
  enforces `UNIQUE(source_id, mode)` (mirror of legacy `UNIQUE(user_id,
  mode)`, `core/src/storage/sqlite.ts:618`); **the amendment tripwire** —
  `acquisition_runs_v2` accepts a `reason='push_delivery'` row and
  `presentation_entries_v2` accepts `provenance='legacy_unknown'` (proves V2
  rev 6 amendments 1–2 landed; refuse the task if either needs a rebuild);
  no existing table is rebuilt (same `sql` text in `sqlite_master`
  before/after — the V3 rev 2 TP5 assertion, reused).
- [ ] **Step 2:** Add the config red test: `RSC_MIGRATION_MANIFEST` defaults
  to `null` and passes through as a path string; no validation beyond
  presence (the file is read/validated by preflight, not config).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Run `npm test -w core -- v4-schema config`; expect FAIL.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Append ONE migration entry at the END of `MIGRATIONS`
  calling `installV4Schema(raw)` in `schema.ts` with the exact Appendix A
  DDL. Add the TS widenings (`migration_review`, `operator_token`, `ops`,
  `SourceSummary.push`/`PushSummary`, `SourceDetail.pushExpiresAt`, the
  `AcquisitionReason` union, `updatedAtProvenance` gains `'legacy_unknown'`
  in the wire type) and `Config.migrationManifestPath`.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Run `npm test -w core -- v4-schema config && npm run typecheck -w core`; expect PASS. Commit per Appendix C.

### Task 2: v2 push lifecycle — store, registration, renewal, cadence

**Files:** Create `core/src/logical/push.ts`,
`core/test/logical-push.test.ts`; modify `core/src/logical/store.ts`,
`core/src/logical/scheduler.ts`, `core/test/logical-scheduler.test.ts`.

**Interfaces:** Produces the `PushRowV2` store methods, `parsePushCapability`,
`maybeRegister`, `renewDue`, `hasActivePush`, and the poll-pass wiring: after
each successful acquisition commit for an eligible source the loop calls
`maybeRegister(sourceId, parsePushCapability(run.pushCapabilityJson))`; each
pass ends with one `renewDue()` sweep then `purgeExpiredPushRows` — v1's
`runPollCycle` tail (`push-in.ts:271-272`) rebuilt over sources. No callback
handling yet.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Add red claim tests: `parsePushCapability` round-trips the
  pinned `{mode,endpoint,topic}` shape, returns null for SQL NULL, and
  returns null (plus one log line) for malformed/unknown-shape JSON;
  registration acts only on the **latest successful run's** claim — a stale
  claim on an older run is inert (spec 1.1).
- [ ] **Step 2:** Add red registration tests (the v1 `maybeSubscribe` shape,
  `push-in.ts:149-164`, rebuilt): eligibility composes three axes — refused
  when operation is `paused`, when governance is `blocked`, or when the
  source is unschedulable (no active subscription, no pending/approved
  federation — reuse V2's schedulability predicate); **quarantined + enabled
  registers normally**; the `checkCallbackUrl` SSRF gate revalidates the
  claimed endpoint at use (private/loopback endpoint → no row, no request);
  an unexpired `pending|active` row blocks a new attempt EXCEPT the
  rsscloud-fallback-with-hub upgrade (`push-in.ts:156-157`); **R1**:
  re-registration against a surviving `(source, mode)` row reuses that row's
  token and secret — new material is generated only when no row exists at
  all (`push-in.ts:79-83` kept verbatim); websub rows are written `pending`
  with the 10-min TTL before the subscribe POST; rsscloud rows are written
  `pending` before register and flip `active` on 2xx with the 25 h TTL.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Add red renewal/purge tests: one sweep per poll pass over
  rows inside their renew horizons (constants imported from
  `push-in.ts:41-46` verbatim), filtered by **current** eligibility (no
  renewal while paused or blocked); the hourly per-row retry floor
  (`RENEW_RETRY_FLOOR_MS`, in-memory like v1 `push-in.ts:174-177`); expired
  rows purge at pass end; **no unsubscribe request is ever sent** — pause,
  block, unsubscribe-to-zero send nothing and the lease lapses (assert zero
  fetch calls).
- [ ] **Step 4:** Add red cadence tests in `logical-scheduler.test.ts`: a
  source with an `active` unexpired push row skips polling until
  `10 * baseInterval` past `lastPollAt` (the durable equivalent of v1's
  `tick % 10` skip, `push-in.ts:264`, composed with V2 §1.3's `lastPollAt`
  comparison — no tick state); `pending` rows do not reduce cadence; the
  claim capture itself stays inert when `pushInEffective` is false (rows are
  never written, sweep never runs — `RSC_PUSH_IN=off` or no public URL).
- [ ] **Step 5:** Run `npm test -w core -- logical-push logical-scheduler`; expect FAIL. Implement `push.ts` + store methods + the scheduler hook. (`ponytail: renewal rides the poll pass like v1; a dedicated scheduler only if lease counts ever make the sweep measurable`)
- [ ] **Step 6:** Run `npm test -w core -- logical-push logical-scheduler && npm run typecheck -w core`; expect PASS. Commit per Appendix C.

### Task 3: v2 callbacks, the pause/block matrix, and the admin push surface

**Files:** Modify `core/src/logical/push.ts`, `core/src/logical/store.ts`,
`core/src/logical/runtime.ts`, `core/src/server.ts`,
`core/src/domain/source-repository.ts`, `core/src/api/logical-routes.ts`;
create `core/test/logical-push-callbacks.test.ts`; modify
`core/test/source-admin-api.test.ts`,
`web/src/routes/admin/sources/[sourceId]/+page.server.ts`,
`web/src/routes/admin/sources/[sourceId]/+page.svelte`,
`web/src/routes/admin/sources/[sourceId]/source-detail.test.ts`.

**Interfaces:** Invoke `.claude/skills/hono/SKILL.md` (core) and the UI/Svelte
skills (web panel) first. The four public callback routes keep their exact
paths (`GET|POST /websub/callback/:token`, `GET|POST /rsscloud/notify`,
`core/src/api/app.ts:407,415,422,428` — Caddyfile exposure set unchanged);
under v2 the server composition supplies `pushInApi` from `createLogicalPush`
instead of `createPushIn` — the route code itself does not change. Produces
`SourceSummary.push` (first writer of the V1-deferred field, narrowed union)
and the admin source-page push block.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Add red verification-GET tests: state-agnostic token+topic
  match (renewal re-verifies while active, v1 `push-in.ts:196-211` shape);
  `hub.mode=denied` **deletes** the row (`push-in.ts:200-202` kept); success
  activates with the granted lease (integer guard on `hub.lease_seconds`);
  websub activation retires a surviving rsscloud fallback row
  (`push-in.ts:208-210`); a valid in-flight challenge completes even when the
  source is paused or blocked — but causes no acquisition and no renewal
  scheduling; unknown token/topic → 404.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Add red fat-ping tests: unknown token 404; bad/missing HMAC
  → silent 202 + log, never 4xx (v1 H2, `push-in.ts:218-221`;
  `verifySignature` imported); eligible source → the body enters the same V2
  acquisition path as a poll (reason `{kind:'push_delivery'}`: §1.5 bounds
  profile, observation writer, reconciliation jobs, commit-time policy
  recheck; run row records reason `push_delivery`); a source with an active
  in-flight acquisition discards the ping at 202 + log (the per-source
  in-flight boolean; the next poll catches up); **paused or blocked**:
  authenticate, neutral 202, body neither parsed nor stored (assert zero
  observation/job rows); **quarantined + enabled**: ingests normally —
  governance alone makes the evidence admin-only, no push-specific branch.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Add red thin-ping/challenge tests: unknown topic → neutral
  200 no-op (no subscription-list oracle) and the 30-second per-topic floor
  (`push-in.ts:238-241` shape); known eligible topic → one acquisition run
  through the ordinary gate, reason `{kind:'push_ping'}`, fire-and-forget;
  paused/blocked → 200 without fetching; rssCloud challenge confirms known
  topics and 404s unknown ones (`push-in.ts:231-234`). Resume-from-pause
  needs no test of its own machinery: V2 §1.3's ordinary next-pass poll IS
  the catch-up (assert only that a resumed source polls on the next pass).
- [ ] **Step 4:** Add red admin-surface tests (extend
  `source-admin-api.test.ts`): `SourceSummary.push` carries exactly
  `{mode, state, endpointFingerprint}` with the two-state union;
  `SourceDetail.pushExpiresAt`; the fingerprint is a stable sha256-prefix
  digest, not the endpoint; **redaction** — seeded `callbackToken` and
  `secret` appear in no list, detail, error, or audit body (extend the
  standing redaction loop over push rows).
- [ ] **Step 5:** Add red web panel tests (`source-detail.test.ts`): the
  admin source page shows push mode/state/expiry beside the acquisition
  health block; no push block renders when `push.mode` is null; no ordinary
  (non-admin) surface changes anywhere.
- [ ] **Step 6:** Run `npm test -w core -- logical-push-callbacks source-admin-api && npm test -w web -- source-detail`; expect FAIL. Implement: callback handlers in `push.ts`, the `pushInApi` v2/v1 branch in server composition (v1 handlers not routed under v2 — V2 §7.4), the summary/detail read join, the panel.
- [ ] **Step 7:** Run the Task 3 Appendix C row; expect PASS. Commit.

### Task 4: Preflight, the versioned manifest, and the operator CLI

**Files:** Create `core/src/migration/preflight.ts`,
`core/src/migration/preflight-cli.ts`, `core/test/migration-preflight.test.ts`;
modify `core/package.json` (script `preflight`), `core/src/config.ts` usage
only if needed.

**Interfaces:** Produces `loadManifest`, `runPreflight`, and the standalone
command `npm run preflight -w core` (run via `cloudron exec`; the CLI loads
config, opens the DB read-only, prints findings as diagnostics, exits
non-zero on any finding). The same `runPreflight` runs in-process before
conversion (Task 8). READ-ONLY: assert no write ever happens.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Add red URL tests: every remote `users.feed_url` must
  normalize under V1's narrow canonicalization (reuse `normalizeSourceUrl`
  from `core/src/domain/source-url.ts` — never a second normalizer);
  missing, malformed, credential-bearing, >2048-char, non-HTTP(S), and
  normalized-colliding URLs each produce an aborting finding naming the
  legacy row; a clean legacy set and a zero-row database both return `[]`.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Add red manifest tests, one per abort class: missing file
  at a configured path; wrong `schemaVersion`; entry keyed by unknown
  `sourceId`; entry whose `feedUrl` mismatches the row's exact legacy URL;
  entry for a non-`instance` row (`feed_type` from migration 11,
  `sqlite.ts:682-688`); duplicate entries; invalid `attributionMode`. No
  manifest configured → null → every instance row takes the unconfirmed
  default (asserted at conversion, Task 5).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Add red reservation tests: a legacy remote handle equal to
  an existing `handle_reservations_v2` handle is an aborting finding
  (re-running preflight after a partial restore must not silently plan a
  double reservation).
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `npm test -w core -- migration-preflight`; expect FAIL.
  Implement; assert read-only via a write-counter (`raw` opened with
  `{readonly:true}` in the CLI; in-process callers pass the live handle and
  the function performs zero writes by construction — SELECTs only).
- [ ] **Step 5:** Run `npm test -w core -- migration-preflight && npm run typecheck -w core`; expect PASS. Commit per Appendix C.

### Task 5: Conversion I — sources, publishers, federation, follows, reservations

**Files:** Create `core/src/migration/convert.ts`,
`core/test/migration-convert.test.ts`; modify `core/src/storage/sqlite.ts`
(reservation guard), `core/src/domain/service.ts` (if the guard surfaces
there), `core/test/service.test.ts`.

**Interfaces:** Produces `runConversion` part 1 over legacy `users`
(`kind='remote'`) and `follows` (`sqlite.ts:623-628`), plus the permanent
reservation guard. Conversion is pure SQL-over-tx — no fetch, no ledger
command; audit rows share one synthetic `commandId` (`migration:<uuid>`),
actor kind `system`.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Add red source-mapping tests: each remote user becomes one
  `remote_sources_v2` row with **the same ID**, normalized canonical URL,
  provenance `migration`, `policy_generation` 0; each source gets a **new**
  publisher ID (never a recycled user ID); `person`/`webfeed` →
  `single_publisher + enabled + allowed + federation none`;
  manifest-approved instances → manifest mode, `allowed + approved`,
  manifest note as provenance; every unconfirmed instance → `aggregate +
  enabled + quarantined + pending`. Local accounts: IDs and handles
  untouched, still local authors.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Add red audit tests: one `migration_review` source-audit
  row (first emitter of the re-added category) for each quarantined instance
  and each manifest approval — and NONE for default person/webfeed
  conversions (those are finding counts only: `default_person`,
  `default_webfeed`). (`ponytail: audit the governance-bearing outcomes; the
  finding counts carry the bulk`)
- [ ] **Step 3:** Add red follow tests: local→local follows preserved
  unchanged; every valid local→remote follow becomes a
  `source_subscriptions_v2` row — `active` for person/webfeed, and
  **`pending_review` for every legacy instance follow regardless of source
  approval** (counts toward the cap, removable, no Personal exposure);
  over-cap users are grandfathered — all existing follows convert
  (`over_cap_grandfathered` counted once per user) and the cap check
  refuses new subscriptions until below `max_subs_per_user` (seeded 500,
  `sqlite.ts:690`).
- [ ] **Step 4:** Add red reservation tests: one `handle_reservations_v2`
  row per remote handle mapping to the converted source + publisher IDs;
  `repo.createLocalUser` and a handle-changing `updateUserProfile` refuse a
  reserved handle through the SAME guard (one check where all callers
  route — service `ensureLocalUser` at `service.ts:25-40`, the direct
  `createLocalUser`, and auth's guest allocation at
  `core/src/api/auth.ts:39-41` all pass through the repo), with the existing
  collision-shaped error (no reserved-vs-taken oracle); the reservation
  survives source deletion (no FK — Appendix A).
- [ ] **Step 5:** Run `npm test -w core -- migration-convert service`; expect
  FAIL. Implement part 1 + the guard. Zero-row conversion is the same code
  path, not a special case.
- [ ] **Step 6:** Run `npm test -w core -- migration-convert service && npm run typecheck -w core`; expect PASS. Commit per Appendix C.

### Task 6: Conversion II — items, deliveries, ancestry, revisions

**Files:** Modify `core/src/migration/convert.ts`,
`core/test/migration-convert.test.ts` (append this task's sections).

**Interfaces:** Converts legacy remote posts (`posts` with `source='remote'`,
migration 1 DDL at `sqlite.ts:576-587`) and `post_revisions`
(`sqlite.ts:667-675`). Converted legacy rows are left in place, **inert** —
no delete, no v2 reader touches them.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Add red identity tests: each remote post becomes one
  logical item **with the same post ID**, one delivery on the same-ID source
  keyed by the legacy `UNIQUE(author_id, guid)` tuple (`sqlite.ts:586` →
  `UNIQUE(source_id, key_kind, key)`), one observation version (synthetic
  `run_id = 'migration'` — no FK on `observation_versions_v2.run_id`, no
  run row), one claim, a selected publisher, and a retained preferred
  delivery; preserved exactly: GUID, permalink, content, `content_markdown`,
  published/arrival dates, reply context.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Add red attribution tests: single-publisher sources select
  the bound publisher; a differing per-item `source_name`/`source_feed_url`
  becomes a `logical_conflicts_v2` row (`attribution_conflict` counted);
  aggregates resolve a provisional publisher from valid per-item attribution
  and fall back to the source-scoped unattributed publisher otherwise;
  quarantined instances' deliveries convert as retained admin evidence,
  ordinarily ineligible from the first read.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Add red ancestry tests: each resolved
  `in_reply_to_post_id` edge copies as a resolved logical parent edge as-is
  (V2 §4.1 permits skipping the retired global-uniqueness fallback); a local
  parent needed as an edge endpoint gets its `logical_local_origins_v2`
  bridge row materialized (V2 §2.6's explicit-backfill site); unresolved
  references convert to `missing` with their bounded asserted context
  (`unresolved_reference` counted); historical items are never merged —
  permalink or publisher+GUID collisions become counted findings
  (`permalink_collision`/`guid_collision`), both items kept.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Add red revision tests: `post_revisions` convert into the
  delivery's accepted presentation chain in `seen_at` order with timestamps
  preserved and provenance **`legacy_unknown`** (accepted by the widened
  CHECK — V2 rev 6 amendment 2); `legacy_unknown` never initializes or
  advances the explicit-update watermark (a later explicit update starts the
  watermark fresh); the wire `updatedAtProvenance` for a converted item
  reads `legacy_unknown` (membership assertion — V2's tests already
  anticipate widening). Inertness: converted `posts`/`post_revisions` rows
  still exist untouched after conversion, and no v2 read joins them.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Run `npm test -w core -- migration-convert`; expect FAIL on
  the new sections. Implement part 2.
- [ ] **Step 6:** Run `npm test -w core -- migration-convert logical-projector && npm run typecheck -w core`; expect PASS (projector suite proves converted items project as ordinary logical items). Commit per Appendix C.

### Task 7: Conversion III — exact push preservation, findings, marker, reset

**Files:** Modify `core/src/migration/convert.ts`,
`core/test/migration-convert.test.ts` (append).

**Interfaces:** Completes `runConversion`: push rows, the findings contract
(log lines + per-kind counts), and the caller-visible counts the runtime
seals into the marker with the cutover reset (Task 8 owns the transaction
composition).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Add red push-preservation tests with **byte-exact column
  assertions**: every unexpired legacy `push_subscriptions` row
  (`sqlite.ts:607-620`) that passes revalidation (URL parse +
  `checkCallbackUrl` on the endpoint — no network) becomes one
  `push_subscriptions_v2` row on the same-ID source preserving exactly
  protocol, endpoint, topic, callback token, secret, state
  (`pending → pending`, `active → active`), expiry, and creation time
  (`push_preserved` counted); an expired row or one failing revalidation
  converts to **no live row** — one log line + `push_expired`/`push_invalid`
  count; quarantined sources retain their active leases. Conversion sends no
  subscribe/unsubscribe/verify/fetch (assert zero fetch calls across the
  whole conversion).
- [ ] **Step 2:** Add red findings tests: `runConversion` returns the
  complete per-kind counts; every non-aborting finding also emitted one log
  line through the injected `log` (spot-check one line per kind); there is
  NO findings relation and NO report route (`ponytail: add the queryable
  report if paging is ever requested`).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Run `npm test -w core -- migration-convert`; expect FAIL. Implement.
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `npm test -w core -- migration-convert && npm run typecheck -w core`; expect PASS. Commit per Appendix C.

### Task 8: Cutover — activation extension, both tripwires, reserved-handle redirect

**Files:** Modify `core/src/logical/runtime.ts`, `core/src/server.ts`,
`core/src/api/logical-routes.ts`, `core/test/logical-runtime.test.ts`; create
`core/test/migration-cutover.test.ts`; modify
`web/src/routes/u/[handle]/+page.server.ts`,
`web/src/routes/u/[handle]/u-page.test.ts` (create if absent — verify the
existing test-file name for the `/u/:handle` load before creating; extend in
place if one exists).

**Interfaces:** Extends V2 §7.1's pre-listen activation transaction — never a
second barrier. Startup order for a configured-v2 process: migrations (already
applied by `createSqliteRepository`), then read activation state + conversion
marker **together**, then branch per spec §4.1, then V2's readiness components
plus the push callback handlers. Web: `/u/:handle` for a reserved handle
issues a permanent redirect to `/p/:publisherId` via the v2 handle lookup
(the lookup response gains a `{reserved: true, publisherId}` shape); no
post-purge branch — after purge the redirect target 404s through the ordinary
not-found path (spec WP5).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Add red sequencing tests in `migration-cutover.test.ts`:
  never-activated + no marker → in-process preflight runs; an aborting
  finding fails startup with diagnostics and **commits nothing** (schema and
  legacy data byte-identical after the failure; restart with flag off works);
  a clean preflight → ONE write transaction commits conversion, journal
  initialization with its first reset generation, the cutover `reset`, the
  marker (`converted_at` + `conversion_findings_json` per-kind counts),
  activation timestamps, and state `active` — fault injection anywhere
  before commit leaves a legacy-intact database that retries next start;
  marker present → conversion skipped, ordinary V2 §7.1 re-activation;
  conversion runs at most once across restarts.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Add red tripwire tests: **(a)** marker present +
  `RSC_SOURCE_MODEL_V2=off` → startup error naming the backup-restore
  procedure (same fail-loud pattern as the `database is newer than this
  build` guard, `sqlite.ts:696-697`); **(b)** activation `active` + NO
  marker → named startup error, never a silent skip (spec WC3). Together
  the pair is self-verifying in both directions. (Dev note: a dev database
  activated by V2/V3 before V4 ships trips (b) by design — delete dev data.)
- [ ] **Step 3:** Add red continuity tests: a legacy `push_subscriptions`
  row's callback token authenticates a post-conversion fat ping against the
  converted v2 row (lease continuity — token, secret, topic, and route
  paths all preserved); the first post-cutover renewal happens on the
  ordinary poll-pass sweep when the preserved lease enters its horizon;
  paced acquisition resumes after commit for enabled allowed AND enabled
  quarantined sources; paused and blocked sources stay inactive; the
  capability flip is core-only — `/capabilities` reports V2's exact enabled
  shape (V4 adds no field; exact-equality against V2's shape, the V3 Task 10
  pattern) and an already-deployed web on the memoized-success path follows
  without redeploy (web test may live with the existing capability suite).
- [ ] **Step 4:** Add red redirect tests: `/u/:handle` for a reserved handle
  308-redirects to `/p/:publisherId`; a live local handle renders as today;
  after purging the converted source+publisher the redirect still fires and
  `/p/:publisherId` 404s ordinarily (reservation outlives the target); a
  pre-cutover `/post/:id` permalink resolves to the same-ID logical item.
- [ ] **Step 5:** Run `npm test -w core -- migration-cutover logical-runtime && npm test -w web -- u-page`; expect FAIL. Implement: the runtime extension, the two guards, the lookup shape, the redirect.
- [ ] **Step 6:** Run the Task 8 Appendix C row; expect PASS. Commit.

### Task 9: The ops-token compatibility route

**Files:** Modify `core/src/api/logical-routes.ts` (or `app.ts` — wherever
the v2 route branch lives), `core/src/domain/source-service.ts`; create
`core/test/source-ops-api.test.ts`.

**Interfaces:** Invoke `.claude/skills/hono/SKILL.md` first. V4 is the first
consumer of the route the V1 review deferred; the contract is spec §6
verbatim (V1 plan rev 5 removed its former Task 7 Step 3 text — the spec's
inline block is the binding form):

```http
POST /ops/sources/federation
Authorization: Bearer <RSC_TOKEN>
{"url":"…","attributionMode":"aggregate","category":"operator_policy",
 "note":"configured peer","commandId":"<uuid>"}
```

- [ ] **Step 1:** Add red contract tests: the route exists only under v2
  (off → 404); it invokes `establishFederation` only — same domain
  transition as the admin route, actor kind `operator_token`, actor ID
  `ops:` + first 16 hex of SHA-256(`RSC_TOKEN`) (`RSC_TOKEN` required,
  `core/src/config.ts:44-45`); ledger scope `ops` with the V1-pinned
  fingerprint `["federation", normalizedUrl, attributionMode]` — identical
  replay returns the stored result, changed URL/mode under the same command
  ID → 409 idempotency conflict; `jsonWrite` composed positionally by
  import; `commandId` accepted only in the body.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Add the red authorization matrix (V1 review Finding 3
  adopted): valid bearer succeeds HERE and receives **401 on every
  `/admin/*` route** (no better-auth session → `sessionAuth` 401,
  `core/src/api/auth.ts:64-66`, before `requireAdmin`'s 403 at `:82`);
  invalid bearer fails per the existing bearer contract; admin session on
  this route → this route is token-only (spec: the token's whole surface is
  this one route; a session request here is refused — pin 401); no raw
  token in any success/error/audit body (the fingerprint only).
- [ ] **Step 3:** Run `npm test -w core -- source-ops-api`; expect FAIL.
  Implement: hand-rolled validator, `c.json({error}, status)`, the widened
  `establishFederation` actor kind. Not added to the public Caddy set —
  operators call core internally, exactly like `POST /users` today
  (RUNNING.md curl cheat sheet).
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run `npm test -w core -- source-ops-api source-admin-api && npm run typecheck -w core`; expect PASS. Commit per Appendix C.

### Task 10: Off-flag gates, whole-vertical integration, and the operator runbook

**Files:** Create `core/test/logical-v4-vertical.test.ts`; modify
`docs/superpowers/documentation/RUNNING.md`, `.env.example`,
`core/.env.example`.

**Interfaces:** Proves spec §11 end to end. Gate-assertion off-flag coverage
per WP3: routing assertions only — the existing legacy suites (including
`core/test/push-in.test.ts` and `core/test/push-guard.test.ts`) remain the
behavioral coverage; nothing is duplicated (§7 would delete a duplicate one
release later).

- [ ] **Step 1:** Add off-flag gate assertions: with the flag off, the four
  callback routes dispatch to the v1 handlers (v1 `pushInApi` wiring), the
  ops route and every V4 admin field are absent, preflight/conversion never
  run (no activation row, no marker), and no V4 module is loaded by the
  composition path (assert the v2 push factory and migration modules are
  referenced only inside the v2 branch — a composition-level assertion, not
  an import-graph scanner).
- [ ] **Step 2:** Add the on-flag integration test: seed a representative
  legacy dataset (person + webfeed + manifest-approved instance +
  unconfirmed instance, follows incl. one over-cap user, active + pending +
  expired + invalid push rows, replies with resolved/unresolved parents,
  revisions), flip on, start: assert one pass through the runbook's step-6
  checks — capability shape, SSR-projectable converted timeline, same-ID
  `/post/:id`, reserved-handle redirect data, sane marker counts, preserved
  push state, fat-ping lease continuity, resumed paced acquisition.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Document: RUNNING.md gains the per-instance runbook (spec
  §8 verbatim: deploy dark → preflight via `cloudron exec npm run preflight
  -w core` → Cloudron backup as THE restore point → flip + restart → verify
  list → repeat per instance, alice → bob → main; retirement ships later);
  the rollback posture stated honestly (backup-restore + forward fixes, no
  downgrade path); `RSC_MIGRATION_MANIFEST` and the manifest schema; both
  env examples updated. Update the `RSC_TOKEN` row ("its one remaining job"
  becomes the ops route at cutover).
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run the completion gate (V2 §7.5 unchanged):
  `npm test -w core`, `npm run typecheck -w core`, `npm test -w web`,
  `npm run check -w web`, `npm run build -w web`; all exit 0. Run
  `/ponytail-review` on the branch diff. Commit per Appendix C and stop for
  the whole-vertical review. Cutover on live instances follows the runbook,
  not this plan's execution.

### Task 11: Legacy retirement — a SEPARATE release after cutover has soaked

**Files:** Modify `core/src/server.ts`, `core/src/config.ts`,
`core/src/api/app.ts`, `core/src/domain/push-in.ts` (delete/move),
`core/src/logical/push.ts`, the legacy web loader/action branches, affected
core/web tests; exact inventory fixed at execution time against the then-real
tree.

**Execution gate: do NOT execute with Tasks 1–10.** This task ships as its
own release only after all three instances have soaked on the flipped image
(runbook step 8). Nothing here changes wire contracts — it deletes the branch
the flag kept dark.

- [ ] **Step 1:** Delete the v1 runtime branch: legacy remote polling and v1
  push-in wiring (`createPushIn`/`runPollCycle`, `core/src/server.ts:25,63`),
  moving the pure helpers (`verifySignature`, `choosePushTarget`, constants,
  `pushInEffective`) into `core/src/logical/push.ts`; legacy remote-author
  routes (`POST /users`, `DELETE /users/:handle`); the legacy timeline/feed
  branches; web's v1 loader/action branches. The off-flag gate assertions
  from Task 10 retire with the branch they guarded.
- [ ] **Step 2:** Flip the default: `RSC_SOURCE_MODEL_V2` defaults `on`;
  the variable stays recognized for one release (`off` rejected on a
  converted database per the Task 8 tripwire; meaningless on a fresh one —
  a fresh database converts trivially and activates), then retires entirely
  in a later cleanup. `/capabilities` remains permanently.
- [ ] **Step 3:** Legacy tables are **not dropped**: `users`, `posts`,
  `post_revisions`, `follows`, `subscriptions`, `instance_settings` keep
  live v2/shared roles; legacy `push_subscriptions` and inert remote `posts`
  rows stay per spec 3.2/3.4 (`ponytail: dropping storage is a later cleanup
  batch with zero feature value now; the migration array only ever appends`).
- [ ] **Step 4:** Run the full completion gate; all exit 0. Commit per
  Appendix C; deploy as an ordinary image update to all three instances.

### Task 12: The final cross-vertical contract review gate

**Files:** Create `docs/superpowers/reviews/2026-07-23-cross-vertical-contract-review.md`;
fold resulting revs into the four plans as needed.

**Execution order: FIRST.** This review runs immediately after this plan's
own review, **before Task 1 of any vertical** (spec §11: the review must be
folded into all four plans before any implementation begins). It is listed
last because it is V4's completion-gate precondition. Dispatch it as its own
review in a clean sub-context (the standing `ponytail-review-specs-plans`
practice), over the four plan documents — not code. Checklist (spec §10, plus
this plan's additions):

- [ ] **CHECK vocabulary wide everywhere:** `source_audit_v2.category` nine
  values + `actor_kind` incl. `operator_token` + `command_ledger_v2.actor_scope`
  incl. `ops` (V1 rev 5 Task 1); `item_audit_v2` and
  `blocked_source_tombstones_v2` nine-wide (V3 rev 2 Appendix A);
  `acquisition_runs_v2.reason` four-wide and
  `presentation_entries_v2.provenance` three-wide (V2 rev 6, this plan's
  amendments 1–2); TS enums narrowed per vertical everywhere.
- [ ] **Capability supersession chain frozen:** V1's boolean shape → V2's
  discriminated shape (§5.6) is the ONLY widening; V3 and V4 add no field;
  V1's exact-equality tests are superseded exactly once (V2 Task 5 Step 4a);
  the flip is a value change on the frozen shape, core-only.
- [ ] **Command conventions uniform:** body `commandId` only; fingerprints
  follow `[command, resource, actor, semantic-payload]` — verify every pinned
  fingerprint across the four plans, including this plan's ops route reusing
  V1's `["federation", normalizedUrl, attributionMode]`; `jsonWrite` composed
  by import everywhere (V2 rev 5 export pin).
- [ ] **Lockstep amendments landed:** V1 rev 5 CHECK pin; V2 rev 5's three
  (verification-ready jobs table, broadened interim cleanup,
  `source_aliases_v2` + writer); V2 rev 6's three (this plan); V3 §1.2's
  dated amendment; `policy_generation` owned by V2 (`ALTER TABLE`, V2
  Appendix A); `SourceSummary.push` deferred to V4 and narrowed to the
  two-state union in every mention. Fix the V2 Appendix A stale pointer
  ("validated only by Vertical 3" → 4).
- [ ] **Declared supersessions are declared, not drift:** `updatedAtProvenance`
  + `legacy_unknown` (V4), `AttributionLevel` four-level (V3),
  `ReconciliationClaim` union (V3), `AcquisitionReason` union (V4),
  `establishFederation` actor-kind widening (V4), the capability shape (V2).
- [ ] **No vertical leaks:** each plan's off-flag isolation asserts its own
  additions only; no plan tests another vertical's surface; push code appears
  in no plan before V4; V4 adds no third scheduling loop, no findings
  relation, no new sanitizer path, no new dependency.
- [ ] Record findings in the review document; fold accepted items as
  numbered revs into the affected plans. Only then does Vertical 1's
  implementation begin. Commit per Appendix C.

## Appendix A: exact migration inventory

One migration entry appended at the tail of `MIGRATIONS`
(`core/src/storage/sqlite.ts:566`) calling `installV4Schema(raw)` in
`core/src/logical/schema.ts`. Timestamps are normalized UTC `TEXT`.
Conversion itself (Tasks 5–7) is **not** a migration entry: migrations run
unconditionally at startup; conversion is flag-triggered and marker-guarded.

```text
push_subscriptions_v2(
 id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
 source_id TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES remote_sources_v2(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
 mode TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(mode IN('websub','rsscloud')),
 endpoint TEXT NOT NULL, topic TEXT NOT NULL,
 callback_token TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
 secret TEXT,
 state TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(state IN('pending','active')),
 expires_at TEXT NOT NULL, created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
 UNIQUE(source_id, mode))
CREATE INDEX push_subscriptions_v2_expires ON push_subscriptions_v2(state, expires_at)
handle_reservations_v2(
 handle TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
 source_id TEXT NOT NULL,      -- no FK: the reservation survives source
 publisher_id TEXT NOT NULL,   -- removal and purge (foundation §12)
 created_at TEXT NOT NULL)
ALTER TABLE logical_activation_v2 ADD COLUMN converted_at TEXT
ALTER TABLE logical_activation_v2 ADD COLUMN conversion_findings_json TEXT
```

Notes. The push CASCADE is deliberate (V3 §5.2: purge deletes push state with
the rest of the operational state) and keeps V3's `PRAGMA foreign_key_list`
purge-inventory test green — only RESTRICT edges must be inventoried. The
conversion marker extends V2's activation singleton instead of adding a table
(spec §9 offered the choice; `converted_at IS NOT NULL` is marker-present,
`conversion_findings_json` holds the per-kind counts). There is no findings
relation and no run-claim table: the parse-time capability claim binds to
`acquisition_runs_v2.push_capability_json` (V2 Appendix A, WP4). The
two-state `state` CHECK is the WP1 pin — deliberately narrower than nothing:
migration-time expired/invalid facts are findings, never rows.

## Appendix B: exact V1/V2/V3 integration points

```text
scheduler.ts poll pass          maybeRegister after each successful commit;
                                 renewDue + purgeExpiredPushRows at pass end;
                                 10× skip-if-recent for active-push sources (Task 2)
server.ts pushInApi composition v2 branch supplies createLogicalPush handlers;
                                 v1 handlers not routed under v2 (Task 3)
store.ts claim/commit           AcquisitionReason push kinds through the same
                                 claimAcquisition/commitAcquisition path (Task 3)
sqlite.ts createLocalUser +     handle_reservations_v2 guard — one check where
  updateUserProfile              all callers route (Task 5)
runtime.ts pre-listen barrier   preflight + conversion + marker + reset extend
                                 the ONE activation transaction; both tripwires (Task 8)
logical-routes.ts               handle lookup gains the reserved shape; ops route (Tasks 8–9)
web u/[handle] load             reserved → 308 /p/:publisherId; no post-purge branch (Task 8)
```

Fault-injection tests follow the V2 Appendix D pattern: throw immediately
before marker, journal, and commit; assert the legacy tables and the v2
tables are all unchanged.
