# Four-tab web timeline (SP2) — design

**Milestone:** Per-user feeds / feed-reader (sub-project 2 of 3)
**Date:** 2026-07-19 · **rev 1** (clean-context correctness + ponytail reviews
folded — see `../reviews/2026-07-19-four-tab-timeline-spec-review.md`)
**Depends on:** SP1 engine (commits `8ffd69a..734d8d0` on main) — see
`2026-07-19-per-user-feeds-engine-design.md` for the milestone model.

## Context

SP1 shipped the headless engine: `feed_type ∈ {person, webfeed, instance}` on
remote users, self-serve `POST /me/subscriptions`, and `GET /timeline` filters
`source=local` / `feed_type=instance` composable with `followed_by` (which now
excludes instances at the query level — Decision B). The web home (`/`) is
still the unfiltered firehose: `+page.server.ts` calls `getTimeline({ before })`
with no filter; the only home query params are `?before` (cursor) and `?feed`
(add-remote flash).

SP2 makes the home tabbed. Locked decisions (milestone brainstorm — not
re-litigated here):

- **Four tabs = filters over the one shared pool:** Local (`source=local`) ·
  Federated (`feed_type=instance`) · Personal river (`followed_by=me`,
  instances excluded server-side) · Public river (unfiltered).
- **Default tab:** registered → Personal river; guest/anon → Public river.
  ("Me" is the profile page `/u/<handle>`, not a tab.)
- All subscribe/manage surfaces, the stale add-remote form fix, admin cap UI,
  and feed-type re-tag are **SP3**.

Decisions made in this brainstorm:

- **All four tabs get live SSE prepends** — includes the small core change
  adding `author.feedType` to timeline entries (the follow-up SP1's ledger
  earmarked); Federated live-filtering is blocked on exactly that field.
- **Tabs are `?tab=` on `/`** — single route, one load function, composes with
  `?before`; no new routes, no redirect hop, no-JS-first real links.
- **Personal river includes your own posts** (rev 1). No auto self-follow
  exists, and compose redirects to `/` → Personal default — without
  self-inclusion a registered user's fresh post would be invisible on the page
  they land on.

## Grok findings the design leans on

- Core `/timeline/stream` is firehose-only (no filter params); per-tab live
  filtering must be client-side, like the existing per-route lenses
  (`web/src/lib/lens.ts`: author/followed/thread).
- `author.feedType` is absent from all client-facing entries: `joinedRowToEntry`
  (`core/src/storage/sqlite.ts:36-41`) omits it and its `JoinedRow` input has no
  `u_feed_type`; five joined select sites feed it — `getTimeline` (~:226),
  `getTimelineAfter` (~:252, SSE replay), `getRecentLocalPosts` (~:285),
  `getThread` (~:309), `listRepliesByPostId` (~:411). Live-post emission
  (`bus.emitNewPost` from `createLocalPostAs`/`editLocalPost`/ingest) carries a
  full `User` author, which already includes `feedType`.
- `listFollowing` (`sqlite.ts:196-206`) returns **all** follows unfiltered —
  local users (`feedType` null) and any vestigial instance follows included —
  and its select does carry `feed_type`. The web wrapper (`getFollowing`,
  `web/src/lib/api.ts:54-58`) types the result without `feedType`, discarding it.
- `LiveTimeline.svelte` mounts only when `isFirstPage`; the home's `onPost`
  currently accepts every event (no lens). Edits ride the same `post` SSE event
  (`mergeIncoming`, `web/src/lib/live.ts`); deletes are not streamed.
- Anonymous users are real sessions with follow graphs (`me.isAnonymous`);
  guests have `me == null`.
- MASTER.md (no page override exists): no-JS first-class (tabs = real links,
  active state SSR-rendered, no JS-added classes), jank-free prepends (tab bar
  must not shift), local/remote badge never dropped, both themes independently,
  42rem single column, 150–300ms transitions, visible focus states, ≥4.5:1
  contrast on active and inactive tab text.

## Design

### 1. Core: `author.feedType` on entries + self-inclusive personal river

In `core/src/storage/sqlite.ts`:

- Add `'users.feed_type as u_feed_type'` to the five joined select lists above;
  add `u_feed_type: FeedType | null` to `JoinedRow` (`UsersTable.feed_type` is
  already so typed — no cast anywhere); add `feedType: r.u_feed_type` in
  `joinedRowToEntry`'s author literal. Every `/timeline`, thread, reply, and
  SSE entry then carries `author.feedType`.
- **`followedBy` becomes self-inclusive** (rev 1): the branch's WHERE becomes
  `(posts.author_id = <follower> OR posts.author_id IN (SELECT followed_id …))`,
  keeping the standing instance-exclusion clause (self is local, `feed_type`
  NULL → passes). Accepted semantic side-effect: `/u/:handle/following` (same
  filter) now also shows the owner's own posts — "x's river" reading.

No route or service changes.

### 2. Web plumbing

- `web/src/lib/api.ts` `getTimeline` opts gain `source?: 'local'` and
  `feedType?: 'instance'`; two more `params.push(...)` lines in the manual
  query builder (keep `encodeURIComponent` style — cursor `~` caveat).
- `web/src/lib/types.ts`: author gains
  `feedType?: 'person' | 'webfeed' | 'instance' | null`. (`getFollowing`'s
  return type is the author type, so the follows list picks this up too.)

### 3. Home load — tab routing

`web/src/routes/+page.server.ts`:

- Tab resolution is a **pure helper** (e.g. `web/src/lib/tabs.ts`), unit-tested
  directly: raw `?tab` + `me` → resolved tab. Valid values
  `local | federated | personal | public`. Missing, invalid, **or `personal`
  as a guest** → the viewer's default: **registered/anon with a session →
  their rule (registered → `personal`, anon → `public`), guest → `public`**
  (`me` comes from the layout load via `await parent()` — no duplicate `getMe`
  fetch; a guest never resolves to `personal`, so no login-CTA branch exists).
- Tab → filter: `local → { source: 'local' }` · `federated →
  { feedType: 'instance' }` · `personal → { followedBy: me.user.handle }` ·
  `public → {}`.
- `tab === 'personal'` (always a session-holder): `getTimeline({ before,
  followedBy })`, and **on the first page only** (`!before` — `LiveTimeline`
  only mounts there) in parallel `getFollowing(me.user.handle)`; return
  `followIds = [me.user.id, ...following.filter(u => u.feedType !== 'instance').map(u => u.id)]`
  for the live lens — self included (mirrors the self-inclusive server filter),
  vestigial instance follows excluded.
- Return `tab` (resolved, not raw) so the page renders `aria-current` and the
  pagination link server-side.
- The "Older posts" link becomes `/?tab=<tab>&before=<cursor>` — the resolved
  tab is always explicit in paginated URLs (never omitted as "default"), so
  they stay stable if auth state changes.
- **Form actions preserve the active tab** (rev 1 — named-action URLs replace
  the query string, so today a submit from `/?tab=local` would land on the
  default): form `action` attributes become `?tab=<tab>&/compose` etc., and
  success redirects carry the tab — `redirect(303, '/?tab=<tab>')` for
  `compose`/`deletePost`. `addRemote` instead redirects to
  `/?tab=public&feed=<handle>` regardless of origin: the flash copy ("its
  posts appear in your timeline") is only true on Public — the form itself is
  repointed in SP3.
- `getPeers` widget unchanged.

### 4. Tab bar

Inline `<nav class="tabs" aria-label="Timeline">` in `+page.svelte` (single
consumer — no component file), placed at the top of `<main>`, above the
timeline, inside the 42rem measure. Four real links `/?tab=…` in fixed order
Local · Federated · Personal · Public, always all visible to every viewer.

Styling: **copy the existing `.admin-nav` pattern**
(`web/src/routes/admin/+layout.svelte:35-59` — SSR `aria-current="page"`,
`--color-accent` underline on active, `--color-secondary` inactive, hover
surface), plus the deltas MASTER.md forces: the standing focus-ring pattern
(`box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-ring) 15%, transparent)`),
fixed height so live prepends never move it, 150–300ms transitions, both
themes ≥4.5:1 both states. No new color tokens, no raw hex.

### 5. Live filtering per tab

`web/src/lib/lens.ts` gains two kinds:

```ts
| { kind: 'source'; source: 'local' }      // entry.source === source
| { kind: 'feedType'; feedType: 'instance' } // entry.author.feedType === feedType
```

Home maps the active tab to a lens: local → `source`, federated → `feedType`,
personal → `{ kind: 'followed', followIds }` (existing kind, instance-filtered
set from the load), public → no lens (keep all). `onPost` runs
`keepEvent(entry, lens)` before `mergeIncoming`, exactly like the author/thread
pages. Notes:

- Edit events pass the same lens their post did (same author/source), so edit
  overlay behavior is unchanged; `mergeIncoming`'s stale-edit drop still
  applies after the lens.
- Tab switches are full navigations, so `live`/`edited`/wedge state resets
  naturally; `LiveTimeline` keeps mounting only on `isFirstPage`.

### 6. Errors and empty states

- Core down: `coreDown` banner + empty timeline as today; the load's catch
  branch still returns the **resolved tab** (and empty `followIds`) so the tab
  bar renders with correct active state. (Fail-soft `me: null` from the layout
  makes a transiently-logged-out-looking viewer resolve to `public` — accepted.)
- Invalid `?tab` (or `personal` as guest) → viewer default, no error (UI
  param, not an API).
- Personal, zero follows → empty state: "Your personal river is empty — follow
  people and feeds to fill it," linking to `/u/<handle>/following` (the
  existing manage surface; SP3 replaces it with richer subscribe UX). With
  self-inclusion, a user with own posts but no follows sees their posts, not
  the empty state.
- Federated with no instances / Local with no posts → the existing "empty
  timeline" rendering; no special copy.

### 7. Testing

- **Core** (`npm run -w core test`): extend timeline HTTP tests to assert
  `author.feedType` is present and correct on `/timeline` entries (instance vs
  webfeed vs local-null) — also closes SP1's deferred "no HTTP-layer test for
  source/feed_type params" minor. Thread/replies sites covered by asserting on
  one thread fetch. New test: `followed_by` self-inclusion (own post appears;
  instance-exclusion still holds).
- **Web** (in-container): the tab-resolution helper is tested **directly as a
  pure function** (defaults per auth state, invalid → default, guest+personal
  → public, tab → filter mapping) — no load-spy machinery. Slim load tests:
  personal-tab first-page `followIds` (self included, instances excluded;
  absent on paginated loads), actions preserving `?tab`. Lens unit tests for
  the two new kinds. Existing drift-canary and page tests untouched.
- **Gates:** `npm run -w core typecheck` + `docker compose exec -T web npm run
  check -w web` (type-stripping means vitest alone proves nothing).

## Out of scope (SP2)

- Subscribe & manage surfaces, stale add-remote-form fix, admin cap UI,
  admin feed-type re-tag, OPML UX — **SP3**.
- Feed-type badges on timeline entries (UI legibility beyond the existing
  local/remote badge) — SP3 if wanted; `author.feedType` is now available.
- Server-side SSE filter params, tab persistence (cookie), Federated
  per-instance sub-filters — YAGNI until asked for.
