# RSC — Really Simple Conversations

A feeds-native social timeline. People who post through the instance and
people who post on their own site are equal citizens in the same timeline —
posts, replies, and whole conversations travel as RSS, so following,
threading, and federation all work over open feeds instead of a proprietary
API.

Inspired by Dave Winer's [Textcasting](https://textcasting.org) and [rss.chat](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat).
It uses RSS, OPML, JSON Feed, WebSub, and rssCloud today, and aims to add
IndieWeb interop (IndieAuth, Micropub, Webmention) next — see the roadmap.

## What works today

**One live timeline, four tabs.** Local posts and polled-in remote feed items
share a single server-rendered timeline that updates live over SSE
(Server-Sent Events), filtered through four tabs: **Local** (posts born here),
**Federated** (connected RSC instances), **Personal** (you + who you
follow), and **Public** (everything). Logged-in users land on Personal, guests
on Public. Works with JavaScript off — tabs are plain links and the live
updates are a progressive enhancement, not a requirement.

**Your own feed reader.** Registered users subscribe to any RSS/JSON/Atom
feed by URL (capped per user, admin-configurable), follow people, and manage
it all — subscribe, unfollow, OPML import/export — from their following page.
Feed titles become display names automatically on first fetch.

**Rich posting.** A Markdown composer (built on [Carta](https://github.com/BearToCode/carta))
with syntax highlighting and a live preview. Line breaks, `:shortcode:`
emoji, GFM tables/strikethrough, and syntax-highlighted code blocks all
render through one [unified/remark](https://unifiedjs.com/) pipeline shared
between the editor preview and the published post — so what you preview is
what readers get. Composing opens in a resizable overlay with drafts that
survive a reload. Every post is sanitized server-side before it ever reaches
a browser.

**Live edits.** Authors can edit their own posts after publishing; each edit
keeps a full revision history (browsable per post) instead of silently
overwriting. Because posts travel as feeds, an edit stays current *everywhere
it federated*: it rides the post's stable permalink `guid` with an
`<atom:updated>` marker, so every instance that already ingested the post
detects the change on its next poll or push, updates its copy, and records its
own revision — all over plain RSS, and without bumping the post to the top of
the timeline.

**Real conversations over plain RSS.** Replies are posts. They thread inline
under a post (an outliner-style disclosure wedge) and on a dedicated
conversation page. Threads are reconstructed from feeds using the RSS
`source:` namespace (`source:inReplyTo`) plus RFC 4685 (`thr:in-reply-to`),
with resolve-once matching, honest orphaning when a reference can't be
resolved, and adoption that heals out-of-order arrival — a reply that shows
up before its parent snaps into place when the parent lands.

**Feeds in.** Subscribe to any RSS, Atom, or JSON Feed. Import an OPML
blogroll. Feed discovery resolves an HTML page to its feed (`<link
rel=alternate>`) and ingests h-feed / microformats2 pages directly. Every
outbound fetch is SSRF-guarded with per-hop redirect re-validation.

**Feeds out.** Each user gets an RSS and a JSON feed; the instance also
publishes an all-users firehose at `/users/rss.xml` (Dave's rss.chat
convention). Local posts carry the Textcasting dual contract — rendered,
sanitized HTML for readers *and* the raw `source:markdown` beside it — plus
permalink `guid`s, `source:` attribution, and per-conversation
`source:comments` feeds. New posts are delivered in real time to subscribers
over both WebSub (fat pings) and rssCloud, and RSC receives the same
way (push-in), so federation is live, not just polled.

**Interop with rss.chat.** RSC consumes Dave Winer's rss.chat firehose
with correct per-item author attribution and full threading, and emits the
same `source:` namespace (`source:inReplyTo`, `source:markdown`,
`source:account`, `source:comments`) so his side can round-trip ours — a
conversation can federate A→B→A over nothing but RSS. Our feeds are walkable
by Dave's own [`threadwalker`](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat)
verbatim: local posts use bare permalink `guid`s as the thread key, so his
reference walker reconstructs a RSC conversation with no changes. A
"Connected instances" panel advertises which Textcasting peers an instance
actually threads and interops with (detected from feeds that carry
`source:markdown`).

**Accounts.** Browse and post as an anonymous guest first (you get a
`@guest-xxxxx` handle on first write); upgrade to a permanent email + password
account with hard email verification; or sign in passwordlessly with a
magic link. Password reset included. Sessions and identity are handled by
[better-auth](https://www.better-auth.com/).

**Self-hosting.** A one-command Docker dev stack, and a production stack that
any VPS owner can run behind Caddy with automatic HTTPS (below).

## Roadmap

Not built yet, in rough order: IndieAuth sign-in and Micropub posting-in;
Webmention; OPML-category filtering of sources; media/enclosures and avatar
harvesting from source feeds. Trackable in [`docs/superpowers/specs/`](docs/superpowers/specs/).

## Develop

Docker Compose runs the whole dev stack — no host Node install needed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rmdes/rsc.git && cd rsc
make up                       # core + web + Mailpit, live reload
```

- App: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
- Mailpit (catches every outgoing email — verify links, magic links):
  [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025)
- **Auth API reference (dev only):** with the dev stack up, browse
  <http://localhost:8787/api/auth/reference> for the better-auth OpenAPI/Scalar
  reference (raw spec at `/api/auth/open-api/generate-schema`). Enabled by
  `RSC_AUTH_OPENAPI=on` (set in `compose.yaml`); unset in prod, and the
  web proxy 404s it, so it is never public. After pulling, recreate core once so
  it picks up the env (`docker compose up -d core`). Full how-to + the
  reachability table: RUNNING.md → "Auth API reference (dev only)".

Edits to `core` and `web` hot-reload in the containers (`node --watch` and
`vite dev`). Federation push is off in dev. Run `make` to list every target;
prefer running against host Node instead of Docker? See
[`docs/superpowers/documentation/RUNNING.md`](docs/superpowers/documentation/RUNNING.md)
(Option B).

## Self-host on a VPS

```bash
# 1. Point DNS (A/AAAA) at the server for your domain first.
make prod-env       # prompts for domain + Mailpit password,
                    # generates secrets and writes .env
make prod-up        # build images + start behind Caddy
```

Caddy fronts everything and issues HTTPS automatically for
`RSC_DOMAIN` — no manual certificates. The Mailpit UI is reachable at
`/mail` behind HTTP basic-auth (the credentials `make prod-env` just
generated), since it displays every verify/magic-link email that goes out.
Federation (WebSub + rssCloud) is **on by default** in this stack.

**Mailpit only catches mail — it never delivers it.** That's fine for
trying the instance solo, but for real multi-user email (verification,
magic-link sign-in, password reset) you need real delivery: set
`RSC_SMTP_URL` (and `RSC_MAIL_FROM`) in `.env` to a real SMTP
server, e.g. `smtps://user:pass@smtp.example.com:465`, and redeploy.

## Architecture

Two workspaces in one repo:

- **`core`** — a headless Hono/Node service backed by SQLite, with
  `better-auth` for identity/sessions. It owns feeds, federation endpoints
  (WebSub, rssCloud), the ingest/threading logic, and the timeline API. It is
  never browser-facing.
- **`web`** — the SvelteKit app: the entire UI, and the only thing browsers
  talk to. It renders the timeline, sanitizes and serves content, and proxies
  auth + the SSE stream to core server-side.

In production, Caddy is the front door: it terminates HTTPS and routes core's
small **public** surface (feed/OPML XML, per-conversation comment feeds,
federation callbacks) directly to `core`, while everything else — the whole
UI and all of `/api/auth/*` — goes to `web`. `core` publishes no host ports
and is reachable only through that split. (Auth deliberately goes through
`web`, not straight to core: emailed verify/magic-link clicks are plain GET
navigations with no `Origin` header, and web's proxy supplies the `Origin`
that the auth layer requires.)

## Credits and lineage

RSC stands on ideas and standards it did not invent:

- **Dave Winer** and [textcasting.org](https://textcasting.org) — the
  Textcasting manifesto, RSS, OPML, rssCloud, and the
  [rss.chat](https://github.com/scripting/rss.chat) idea this reimagines.
- **The IndieWeb community** — Micropub, Webmention, IndieAuth, and
  microformats2.
- **JSON Feed** — Manton Reece and Brent Simmons.
- **WebSub** and the broader open-feed ecosystem.

RSC's job is to make these work together, credited, in one place.
