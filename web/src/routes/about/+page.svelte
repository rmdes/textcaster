	<h1>A social timeline built natively on feeds.</h1>

	<p class="lede">
		RSC — Really Simple Conversations — is a social timeline built natively on
		open feeds. People who post <em>through</em> the instance and people
		who post from <em>their own website's feed</em> are equal citizens of the same
		live timeline, and following, replies, and whole conversations travel as
		plain RSS instead of a proprietary API.
	</p>

	<p class="status">Pre-release, but deep — real end to end today, no release cut yet.</p>

	<section>
		<h2>Why it exists</h2>
		<p>
			Social platforms lock your posts, your graph, and your conversations
			inside an API only they control. Open feeds have carried writing across
			the web for two decades — but they were treated as a read-only broadcast
			channel, never as the place a conversation actually lives.
		</p>
		<p>
			RSC's bet is that a conversation can travel over nothing but RSS.
			A reply is a post; a thread is reconstructed from feeds; a conversation
			can federate from one instance to another and back again with no extra
			protocol. If it works over feeds, no single service owns it — and anyone
			who already publishes a feed is already halfway in.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>What it is</h2>
		<ul class="features">
			<li>
				<strong>One live timeline.</strong> Local posts and polled-in remote
				feed items share a single server-rendered timeline that updates live.
				It works with JavaScript off — the live updates are an enhancement, not
				a requirement.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Rich posting.</strong> A Markdown composer with live preview,
				tables, emoji shortcodes, and syntax-highlighted code. What you preview
				is what readers get, and every post is sanitized before it reaches a
				browser.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Real conversations over plain RSS.</strong> Replies thread
				inline and on a dedicated conversation page, reconstructed from feeds —
				with honest orphaning when a parent is missing and healing when a reply
				arrives before its parent.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Feeds in.</strong> Subscribe to any RSS, Atom, or JSON Feed,
				import an OPML blogroll, or point at a plain web page and let discovery
				find its feed. Every outbound fetch is guarded against SSRF.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Feeds out, live.</strong> Each user gets an RSS and JSON feed,
				and the instance publishes an all-users firehose. New posts are pushed
				to subscribers in real time over WebSub and rssCloud — so federation is
				live, not just polled.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Interop with rss.chat.</strong> RSC round-trips rss.chat: a
				conversation can federate A→B→A over plain RSS, and our feeds are
				walkable by its thread walker unchanged.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Accounts.</strong> Browse and post as a guest first, then
				upgrade to a verified email account or sign in with a magic link.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Self-hosting.</strong> A one-command Docker dev stack, and a
				production stack that runs behind Caddy with automatic HTTPS.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p class="next">
			<strong>Next, not yet built:</strong> IndieAuth sign-in and Micropub
			posting-in, Webmention, and optional ActivityPub reach into the fediverse.
		</p>
	</section>

	<section>
		<h2>How it works</h2>
		<p>
			Under the hood there are two parts: a headless core service that owns the
			feeds, federation, threading, and the timeline, and a web app that is the
			only thing your browser talks to. The core speaks open standards the rest
			of the web already understands — RSS, OPML, JSON Feed, WebSub, and
			rssCloud — so it federates with other sites and instances directly,
			without anyone adopting an RSC-specific protocol.
		</p>
		<p>
			The page you're reading, and every post, is rendered and sanitized
			through a single trusted path on the server before it ever reaches a
			browser. Nothing else is a browser-facing surface.
		</p>

				conversations RSC interops with.

			<li><strong>The IndieWeb community</strong> — Micropub, Webmention, IndieAuth, and microformats2.</li>
